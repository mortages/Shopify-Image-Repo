# Fall 2021 - Shopify Developer Intern Challenge

### Overview 
Cloudinary is a SaaS solution that allows users to manage photos and videos. This project creates a command-line interface that allows you to upload, view, and delete images from your Cloudinary image repository. 

### Getting Started
To get started, you'll first need to create a Cloudinary account by going here: https://cloudinary.com

Then, install the project's dependencies by running `mvn install` in the root directory, and start the program by running the `main` method inside `Main.java`.

### Features
- Upload an image
- Query an image by it's title (public_id)
- View all images
- Delete an image by it's title (public_id)

### Demo
The following video walks you through the application's main functionality. 

Note: I didn't demo logging-in in order to ensure the privacy of my API Key & API Secret.
